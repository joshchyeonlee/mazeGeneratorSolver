mazeSolver.py README

Project inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xthh4SEMA2o&ab_channel=DavisMT

To run, build and press spacebar on the keyboard - maze creation and solution will automatically occur back to back once the spacebar is pressed.
Window can be closed to terminate program.

Program implements pygame.py to generate a randomized maze from a 2D matrix using a backtracking algorithm and solves the maze from the starting (top left) coordinate to the end (bottom right) through a brute force method.

WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT, CELL_WIDTH, CELL_HEIGHT can be altered as long as cell dimensions can divide window dimensions evenly.
